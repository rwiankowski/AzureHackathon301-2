# Challenge 1

## Part A

Objectives:

* Create two Virtual Machines to act as File Servers
* Create a Storage Account to centralize file share data
* Configure Azure File Sync between the Storage Account and both VMs
* Test by copying files into one of the VMs and directly into the Storage Account File Share

## Part B

Objectives:

* Configure backup for the Virtual Machines - minimize the total cost of storing the backups, considering that they will be accessed infrequently
* Configure backup for the Storage Account - make sure that you will be able to restore the data in case of a region-wide failure
